# üé≤ Week 8: Functions (continued) / Strings

Dear all,

We hope you all had a great week! With 2 more weeks of the course left, we hope that you are all looking forward to taking your knowledge to the next level!

- This week, we continued on the usage of functions
- We learned function arguments, with parameter keyword, default values, and multiple function outputs.
- We saw the different methods for strings.
- We looked at the differences between `==` and `is`
- During labs, we worked on grade management system that have very similar structure to the final project.

* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ‚è© icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)
